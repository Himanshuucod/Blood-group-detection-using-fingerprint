Blood Group Detection Using Fingerprint
Overview

This project demonstrates a Deep Learning-based approach for predicting blood groups using fingerprint images. Multiple CNN architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet34, and VGG16 were explored and evaluated.

⚠️ Important Notice

This project is developed strictly for educational and research purposes only.

It is NOT intended for medical diagnosis, clinical use, or real-world medical reporting.
The predictions generated by this model must NOT be treated as medical results or official blood group reports.

Important Repository Notes

To keep the repository lightweight and professional, the following files and folders are intentionally NOT included:

❌ Dataset folder (dataset/)

❌ Trained model files (*.keras, *.h5)

❌ Jupyter checkpoint folders (.ipynb_checkpoints/)

❌ Large raw image files

These files were removed to:

Prevent oversized uploads

Follow GitHub best practices

Keep the repository clean and easy to clone

If you wish to use the project fully, you must:

Download the dataset separately.

Train the model locally to generate your own .keras or .h5 files.

Installation

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Train Model

Open and run any notebook inside the code/ directory to train a model.

2. Run Streamlit App

If using the Streamlit interface:

streamlit run app.py
